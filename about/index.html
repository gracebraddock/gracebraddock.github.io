        	<h1>About Me</h1><p>
		I am currently in my third year in English Literature and Language at the University of Sheffield. I am an aspiring writer and journalist and have a keen interest in sharing my opinions on current affairs and social issues as well as investigating stories that are under-represented within the media. 
</p><p>
At the end of my second year I began contributing to my University newspaper ‘Forge’. 
I have written a comment piece on Theresa May’s absence from the debates and a feature article on the phenomenon ASMR, which includes an interview with one of the first psychologists to research the area. 
</p><p>
I am hoping to study for a Masters next year in either Global Journalism or Investigative Journalism. 
</p><p>
Other than my writing experience, I also completed 5 days work experience at UNCUT magazine in London, where I obtained the invaluable skill of transcription, which I quickly grew to enjoy and thrive at. 
</p><p>
Any support for my website is greatly appreciated and I hope you enjoy reading.
