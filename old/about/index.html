        	<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>
			In 2018 I graduated from the University of Sheffield with a 2:1 in English Literature and Language.  
			I am now studying for a masters in Interactive Journalism at City, University of London.  
			I have a keen interest in politics, social issues and writing so I have combined those interests to pursue a
			number of journalism work experience opportunities. This website acts as a portfolio of the
			work I have written for a variety of publications, as well as articles I have written for fun to
			gain more experience.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am driven by the core values of justice,
			accountability and transparency, which is why using social platforms to speak up against
			injustices is so important to me. I am very active on Twitter and enjoy learning and sharing
			content that aims to hold people to account. However, this website I have created is especially helpful to
			me when speaking out against world issues and expressing my thoughts, as there are less
			limitations. Being able to delve into issues in depth, do thorough research, and explore
			counter arguments to my points is essential for me to deliver articles that I can stand by
			proudly.
		</p>
		<p>
			Any support for my website is greatly appreciated and I hope you enjoy reading.	
		</p>

			If you would like more regular updates and to hear more of my thoughts then my Twitter
			handle is <a href="https://twitter.com/gracebraddock">@gracebraddock</a>
