<h3> Police numbers in the West Midlands fall by 40% in eight years as crime reaches ten-year high </h3>

<p>Police numbers across the West Midlands have fallen by 40% since 2012 compared with a 14% decline in England and Wales since 2010.</p>

<p>Freedom of Information requests to West Midlands Police revealed that all boroughs across the metropolitan county have seen a significant fall in police numbers and reached a ten-year high in crime. </p>

<p> This comes amid reports that the West Midlands had the highest increase in knife crime in the country before the coronavirus outbreak and the second highest number of car crimes, including thefts and break-ins, behind London. </p>

<p> The interactive map shows how police numbers and numbers per 10,000 people have changed in the county by borough over an eight-year period. </p>

<p> The West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner blamed the rise in crime on cuts, saying: “The government needs to take note of these statistics and give forces like West Midlands Police the resources we need. These figures are testament to the need for increased long term funding for policing.” </p>

<p>“Government cuts have meant West Midlands Police has lost more than 2,100 police officers since 2010 and seen its budget shrink by £175m. Even with the Prime Minister’s announcement of additional police officers, our force is only due to receive 1,200 officers back over the next 3 years far short of what we’ve lost.”</p>

<p>The Dudley borough has been the worst affected by police cuts and a rise in crime since 2012, with Stourbridge and Halesowen and Rowley Regis constituencies being particularly hard hit by police cuts.</p>

<p>Burglary has almost doubled in Dudley since 2012. Nicky Brown from Stourbridge was the victim of a home invasion in 2017 and believes burglary isn’t taken seriously enough by police because of cuts. </p>

<p>“I felt personally that the police weren’t actually bothered that someone had come in the house so although they came quite quickly I don’t really think that they do anything to deter people from doing burglaries” </p>
<p> “I look on Facebook and there’s hundreds [of posts about burglaries], it’s almost like they’re doing one or two a night. We need more police out on the beat so that they’re more proactive than reactive." </p>
<p> “I don’t feel that burglary is a petty crime, it’s scary. I think that because they’re so short on the ground, they didn’t really do anything about it and therefore the people that are doing the burglaries are just going to carry on. They need to deal with it like a proper criminal investigation and do more to catch them at it.” </p>
