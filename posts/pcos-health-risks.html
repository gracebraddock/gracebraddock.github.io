    <h1>PCOS is more than just a fertility issue: the hidden health risks and dismissal of women’s health problems</h1> 

<p><i>PCOS the most common endocrine disorder globally and is on the rise but remains misunderstood by doctors and patients alike. Grace Braddock explores some of the lesser known health risks associated with the disorder.</i></p>

<p>Polycystic ovary syndrome is one of the most common causes of infertility and results in heartache for many women desperate to conceive, but it’s more than just an infertility issue. </p>

<p>Besma, 20 was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) at 19 and has been left frustrated that her health concerns are dismissed: “PCOS is extremely damaging to a woman's quality of life and every aspect of her life. Yet, everyone chooses to ignore all of this and focus solely on fertility.” </p>

<p>PCOS is a common reproductive and endocrinologic disorder that affects 1 in 10 women worldwide. PCOS is caused by an imbalance in the hormones. This usually happens when a hormone called LH or levels of insulin are too high, which then causes the ovaries to produce excess testosterone.</p>

<p>In an interview with the Atlantic Dr John Nestler, an endocrinology and metabolism expert,  said: “Classically, we thought of PCOS primarily as an infertility disorder or a cosmetic annoyance, but we now know that it’s also a metabolic disorder and a serious long-term health concern.”</p>

<p>As well as having concerns for her overall health, Besma also experiences low self-esteem due to the condition: “PCOS is a social disadvantage and not corresponding to a certain norm can [affect] someone’s life. When I see my facial hair and my abnormal body hair I worry about how other people perceive me.</p>

<p>“The most problematic is obviously the facial hair because people can see it. If I wax it, I break out and it comes back four days later, if I pluck it I have scarring and ingrown hairs. My boobs never developed normally as well, I later found out that I have a deformity called tubular breasts I highly suspect it’s linked to PCOS and some doctors think it is,” Besma says.</p>

<p><b><u>Comorbidities are more common</u></b></p>

<p>Tubular breasts is a condition where breast tissue grows abnormally which may result in elongated, ‘droopy’ breasts with protruding nipples. While uncommon it is a known symptom of PCOS. This is not the only health condition associated with the syndrome.</p>

<p>Dr Stephen Franks, a Professor of Reproductive Endocrinology at Imperial College London, says that comorbidities are more common in women with PCOS. </p> 

<p>“A good example would be hypertension that’s been recognised for a while. Women with PCOS have significantly higher blood pressure than [women without PCOS],” Dr Franks says. </p>

<p>Vascular problems are also common in women with PCOS but according to Dr Franks, comorbidities are “multifactorial like many of the problems that you see with PCOS” and he believes that most issues arise when a women with PCOS is overweight or obese. </p>

<p><b><i>“There’s about a ten times higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes”</i></b></p>

<p>One of the biggest health risks linked to PCOS is type 2 diabetes. Dr Abbi Lulsegged, an  Endocrinologist and Consultant Physician, says: “There’s about a ten times higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes [in women with PCOS], it’s shocking and unfortunately that can happen even in lean women who are not necessarily overweight.</p>

<p>“Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of heart disease and the longer one is exposed to diabetes then the longer they run the risk of developing complications associated with it so it is a very dangerous situation.”</p>


<p><b><i>Disappointing doctors </i></b></p>

<p>Despite all these risks, many women are left feeling dismissed and disappointed by doctors. </p>

<p>Beth*, 26 says: “Doctors often just give me birth control and push me out the door. So much so that I don't even bother seeing a new doctor as I have seen at least five and got the same response every time.”</p>

<p>Lina Breidokienė, 25 was originally diagnosed at 15 years old but was offered no treatment and was later put on the pill which she removed herself from as she “couldn't take the side effects anymore”. After changing clinics at 24 she was re-diagnosed with PCOS by her new doctor. </p>

<p>“She explained that it'll be difficult for me to get pregnant and told me to take birth control until I wanted to get pregnant at which point she would put me on fertility treatment. I hadn't asked her about pregnancy. She didn't mention any alternative treatments or health implications,” Lina says. </p>

<p>Dr Franks admits there is still a lot of misunderstanding of the disorder which leads to patients being dismissed. “I’m afraid that still happens. There’s more awareness now amongst GPs, but there are endocrinologists or gynaecologists who are equally culpable.” </p>

<p>According to Dr Franks, “what’s worse than being unaware is giving misleading information”. </p>

<p><b><i>“I can understand why women often report dissatisfaction
 with treatment received”</i></b></p>
 
<p> Some doctors still inform women that their PCOS diagnosis means they will struggle with infertility. While PCOS is a common cause of infertility not all women struggle to conceive and it is the most treatable cause of infertility. Dr Franks says that doctors are starting to improve on this issue but “at the other end of the spectrum women who have obesity [experience problems] as not all GPs are aware of the long-term risks of PCOS.” </p>

<p>Dr Ian Campbell has dealt with a lot of PCOS as a GP. He says: “I can understand why women often report dissatisfaction with treatment received. This may result from poor knowledge among GPs and referral to specialists is very limited.” </p>

<p>According to Dr Campbell though there’s “very little” doctors can do aside from make weight control a priority but he recognises “the benefits are minimal” due to the metabolic issues women with PCOS experience that cause weight management to be difficult. </p>

<p>On the other hand Cindy Eades, 41 who was diagnosed with PCOS five years ago has had a positive experience with her endocrinologist: “As far as treatment it’s pretty standard what he does, I do regular blood tests and so forth.” </p>

<p>“The thing that I really love is that he sat down with me with my lab report and he said ‘I don’t take this as gospel… if you have symptoms that aren’t showing up on your labs I’m still going to listen to you’ and so we really collaborate together,” Cindy says. </p>

<p><b><i>Similar endocrine disorders </i></b></p>

<p>Cindy also suffers with a condition called Non-classical Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (NCAH) which has similar symptoms to PCOS. However, while polycystic ovaries are observed in up to 40% of NCAH patients, the features that differentiate NCAH include early puberty and a lack of insulin resistance.</p>

<p>Cindy was diagnosed with NCAH at 13 after experiencing very low energy and excessive hair growth on her legs. </p>

<p>“When I was first diagnosed, it was a rule out diagnosis. Now they’ve developed a test which you can definitively see if you have the NCAH and they see that I do have that and I still have the cysts on my ovaries, so I still have both conditions,” Cindy says.</p>
