    <h1>PCOS is more than just a fertility issue: the hidden health risks and dismissal of women’s health problems</h1> 

<p><i>PCOS the most common endocrine disorder globally and is on the rise but remains misunderstood by doctors and patients alike. Grace Braddock explores some of the lesser known health risks associated with the disorder.</i></p>

<p>Polycystic ovary syndrome is one of the most common causes of infertility and results in heartache for many women desperate to conceive, but it’s more than just an infertility issue. </p>

<p>Besma, 20 was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) at 19 and has been left frustrated that her health concerns are dismissed: “PCOS is extremely damaging to a woman's quality of life and every aspect of her life. Yet, everyone chooses to ignore all of this and focus solely on fertility.” </p>

<p>PCOS is a common reproductive and endocrinologic disorder that affects 1 in 10 women worldwide. PCOS is caused by an imbalance in the hormones. This usually happens when a hormone called LH or levels of insulin are too high, which then causes the ovaries to produce excess testosterone.</p>

<p>In an interview with the Atlantic Dr John Nestler, an endocrinology and metabolism expert,  said: “Classically, we thought of PCOS primarily as an infertility disorder or a cosmetic annoyance, but we now know that it’s also a metabolic disorder and a serious long-term health concern.”</p>

<p>As well as having concerns for her overall health, Besma also experiences low self-esteem due to the condition: “PCOS is a social disadvantage and not corresponding to a certain norm can [affect] someone’s life. When I see my facial hair and my abnormal body hair I worry about how other people perceive me.</p>

<p>“The most problematic is obviously the facial hair because people can see it. If I wax it, I break out and it comes back four days later, if I pluck it I have scarring and ingrown hairs. My boobs never developed normally as well, I later found out that I have a deformity called tubular breasts I highly suspect it’s linked to PCOS and some doctors think it is,” Besma says.</p>

<p><b><u>Comorbidities are more common</u></b></p>

<p>Tubular breasts is a condition where breast tissue grows abnormally which may result in elongated, ‘droopy’ breasts with protruding nipples. While uncommon it is a known symptom of PCOS. This is not the only health condition associated with the syndrome.</p>

<p>Dr Stephen Franks, a Professor of Reproductive Endocrinology at Imperial College London, says that comorbidities are more common in women with PCOS. </p> 

<p>“A good example would be hypertension that’s been recognised for a while. Women with PCOS have significantly higher blood pressure than [women without PCOS],” Dr Franks says. </p>

<p>Vascular problems are also common in women with PCOS but according to Dr Franks, comorbidities are “multifactorial like many of the problems that you see with PCOS” and he believes that most issues arise when a women with PCOS is overweight or obese. </p>

<p><b><i>“There’s about a ten times higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes”</i></b></p>

<p>One of the biggest health risks linked to PCOS is type 2 diabetes. Dr Abbi Lulsegged, an  Endocrinologist and Consultant Physician, says: “There’s about a ten times higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes [in women with PCOS], it’s shocking and unfortunately that can happen even in lean women who are not necessarily overweight.</p>

<p>“Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of heart disease and the longer one is exposed to diabetes then the longer they run the risk of developing complications associated with it so it is a very dangerous situation.”</p>


<p><b><i>Disappointing doctors </i></b></p>

<p>Despite all these risks, many women are left feeling dismissed and disappointed by doctors. </p>

<p>Beth*, 26 says: “Doctors often just give me birth control and push me out the door. So much so that I don't even bother seeing a new doctor as I have seen at least five and got the same response every time.”</p>

<p>Lina Breidokienė, 25 was originally diagnosed at 15 years old but was offered no treatment and was later put on the pill which she removed herself from as she “couldn't take the side effects anymore”. After changing clinics at 24 she was re-diagnosed with PCOS by her new doctor. </p>

<p>“She explained that it'll be difficult for me to get pregnant and told me to take birth control until I wanted to get pregnant at which point she would put me on fertility treatment. I hadn't asked her about pregnancy. She didn't mention any alternative treatments or health implications,” Lina says. </p>

<p>Dr Franks admits there is still a lot of misunderstanding of the disorder which leads to patients being dismissed. “I’m afraid that still happens. There’s more awareness now amongst GPs, but there are endocrinologists or gynaecologists who are equally culpable.” </p>

<p>According to Dr Franks, “what’s worse than being unaware is giving misleading information”. </p>

<p><b><i>“I can understand why women often report dissatisfaction
 with treatment received”</i></b></p>
 
<p> Some doctors still inform women that their PCOS diagnosis means they will struggle with infertility. While PCOS is a common cause of infertility not all women struggle to conceive and it is the most treatable cause of infertility. Dr Franks says that doctors are starting to improve on this issue but “at the other end of the spectrum women who have obesity [experience problems] as not all GPs are aware of the long-term risks of PCOS.” </p>

<p>Dr Ian Campbell has dealt with a lot of PCOS as a GP. He says: “I can understand why women often report dissatisfaction with treatment received. This may result from poor knowledge among GPs and referral to specialists is very limited.” </p>

<p>According to Dr Campbell though there’s “very little” doctors can do aside from make weight control a priority but he recognises “the benefits are minimal” due to the metabolic issues women with PCOS experience that cause weight management to be difficult. </p>

<p>On the other hand Cindy Eades, 41 who was diagnosed with PCOS five years ago has had a positive experience with her endocrinologist: “As far as treatment it’s pretty standard what he does, I do regular blood tests and so forth.” </p>

<p>“The thing that I really love is that he sat down with me with my lab report and he said ‘I don’t take this as gospel… if you have symptoms that aren’t showing up on your labs I’m still going to listen to you’ and so we really collaborate together,” Cindy says. </p>

<p><b><i>Similar endocrine disorders </i></b></p>

<p>Cindy also suffers with a condition called Non-classical Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (NCAH) which has similar symptoms to PCOS. However, while polycystic ovaries are observed in up to 40% of NCAH patients, the features that differentiate NCAH include early puberty and a lack of insulin resistance.</p>

<p>Cindy was diagnosed with NCAH at 13 after experiencing very low energy and excessive hair growth on her legs. </p>

<p>“When I was first diagnosed, it was a rule out diagnosis. Now they’ve developed a test which you can definitively see if you have the NCAH and they see that I do have that and I still have the cysts on my ovaries, so I still have both conditions,” Cindy says.</p>  

<p>Another similar endocrine disorder that may have links to PCOS is fibroids. Karis Reid, 29 has experienced a particularly severe case of fibroids and has suspected PCOS: “I’ve had several procedures, two where I’ve been awake and they tried to remove the fibroid both unsuccessful and two operations, first one they were unable to remove it and then it was successfully removed the second time.” </p>

<p>Fibroids are typically more common in older women and don’t usually require surgery but as a mixed-race woman, Karis was at higher risk. According to Black Women’s Health Imperative, compared to white women, black women are two to three times more likely to have fibroids, to develop them at younger ages, to have frequent and bigger fibroids, and to have more symptoms. Hospitalisation for fibroids is three times higher for black women than white women. The reasons for the increased risk of fibroids in black women are not well understood. </p> 

<p>“After my last surgery I was told I still had some small ones floating around but they were just focusing on the one that was causing me problems to conceive first,” Karis says. </p>

<p>After getting pregnant another fibroid developed at the top of her uterus. “Around 24ish weeks I went into hospital for a few days as I was in agonising pain which they said was from the fibroid. It has maintained its size now, however I’m unsure whether I will need an operation after giving birth to remove it.” </p>

<p><b><i>“Anxiety and depression are much more
    common in women with PCOS”</i></b></p>

<p>As well as the physical health repercussions of PCOS and other endocrine disorders, poor mental health is more common in women who suffer with PCOS. </p>

<p>Besma suffers with depression and low self-esteem due to her PCOS. She says: “The problem about doctors nowadays is that they focus solely on physical health and in the case of PCOS your ability to procreate. What they often fail to realise is how damaging PCOS is to people's quality of life. It comes with years of heartache and possible trauma, it never stops and could never get better. In my opinion, mental health should be a priority given how prevalent it is.”</p>

<p>A 2018 study from Cardiff university revealed that there is a significant link between depression and anxiety and having PCOS. According to Dr Franks: “Anxiety and depression are much more common in women with PCOS and even if you correct for obesity it remains significant.” </p>

<p>Explaining more about why this may be, he says: “There are several factors that are involved so if you spend half an hour removing hair from your face before you can go out in the morning then it’s not surprising that you feel depressed and have low self-esteem.”</p>

<p>Dr Lulsegged theorises that women with PCOS “might harbour genetic variants in the gene  that metabolises both oestrogen and adrenaline so that it doesn’t work very well… so they feel like they’re in flight or fight mode longer than normal and they get anxious easily”.</p>

<p>But it’s not just poor mental health that is common among women with PCOS, disordered eating is also a problem.</p>

<p><b><i>“Disordered eating does seem to be more 
prevalent in women with PCOS”</i></b></p>

<p>Sara, 28 experiences intense sugar cravings due to her PCOS but purges because of pressure to lose weight. She was encouraged to see a therapist who diagnosed her with bulimia. “[The therapist] was very surprised that [my diagnosis] wasn’t obvious to me but I saw myself as more of a binge eater because I wasn’t super skinny,” Sara says. </p>

<p>Dr Franks says: “Disordered eating does seem to be more prevalent in women with PCOS and that might partly contribute to the cause of obesity but it might also be they’re trying to compensate for the obesity.”</p>

<p>Research has indicated that women with PCOS have elevated prevalence and risk factors for binge eating behaviour. While there’s no definitive research showing a direct link between bulimia and PCOS, Dr Lulsegged predicts that bulimia would be more likely to be directly associated with women with PCOS than anorexia. </p>

<p>Sugar and carbohydrate cravings are common in women with PCOS in part because of insulin resistance meaning the body has trouble maintaining a stable blood sugar. </p>

<p>Dr Lulsegged says that the sugar fluctuation seen in women with PCOS “causes the blood sugars to plummet and when it plummets that can cause headaches, dizziness, light headedness, irritability, brain fog, sugar cravings and hunger pangs because the brain has lost its energy source”.</p>

<p>The solution for this phenomenon is where advice seems to differ. Dr Lulsegged is in favour of a low-carb diet that “starves the beast”, the beast being insulin resistance. Dr Franks believes that too many issues are misguidedly attributed to insulin resistance and instead recommends a balanced, high-fibre diet with the focus being on calorie deficit rather than low-carbs. </p>

<p>This lack of consensus on how best to improve symptoms and avoid developing health complications is not confined to these two endocrinologists. The literature surrounding the best diet choices for PCOS is even more confusing. Some suggest keto, others suggest a vegan diet, there are recommendations to go gluten-free, dairy-free, sugar-free, leaving many questioning what exactly they can eat. </p>

<p><b><i>“With the drug only approach [you] treat the
 consequences but not the root causes”</i></b></p>

<p>The lack of consensus on the issue could be down to a lack of research showing definitive results for one course of action and according to Dr Franks “there’s never enough funding for research into women’s health”.</p>

<p>The difference in opinion on the best course of action does not stop at dietary recommendations. Dr Lulsegged is not in favour of prescribing the pill to treat PCOS, saying: “All you’re doing with the drug only approach is to treat the consequences but not the root causes and that’s not what they need, they need a root cause approach.”</p>

<p>Dr Franks on the other hand thinks that “the pill shouldn’t be universally prescribed but it’s often very helpful in [symptomatic] management” saying that for women who have painful, heavy periods their “life can be transformed by being on the pill”.</p>

<p>Opinion differs among patients, some feel like they are stuck on the pill without it offering any real solution. One patient who wouldn’t be without birth control is Mori Skelton, 22. “I'm constantly singing my new birth control’s praises,” Mori says, telling me that it has helped prevent cysts from bursting which left them in agonising pain. </p>

<p>One thing both endocrinologists and patients can agree on is that there isn’t enough support given to women who are asked to make lifestyle changes to improve their PCOS symptoms. </p>

<p>“At this point I’ve started researching it myself. I jumped head first into keto, which I found unsustainable long term. That was discouraging, but I kept looking for answers. I found a local support group and one on Reddit and they have been amazing resources,” Lina tells me.</p>

<p>Dr Lulsegged described the need for support for women as “mandatory” and according to Dr Franks the need for more support “applies generally to people who are overweight and struggling to lose weight, there just aren’t sufficient resources”. </p>

<p><b><i>“At this point I’ve started researching it myself”</i></b></p>

<p>Other issues women face are having abnormal cases of PCOS leading to difficulties with diagnosis. Beth* had some mild symptoms such as hirsutism and irregular periods but doesn’t struggle with her weight or have high sugar levels. </p>

<p>“My blood tests were not really out of balance so in order to confirm I had PCOS they had to check if I had cysts in my ovaries and that was when it was confirmed,” she says. </p>

<p>This is an issue that Dr Franks is all too aware of. In the 80s he and his colleagues discovered that “the spectrum of presentation was beyond just the combination of androgen excess and anovulation” which led to the diagnosis criteria being broadened in 2003. </p>

<p>“There’s still been some scepticism [but there’s] very strong evidence that we’re dealing with the same spectrum of a disorder than we are with the more narrow diagnosis,” Dr Franks says. </p>

<p>For Besma a diagnosis gave her a sense of relief and devastation. She felt relief that she hadn’t imagined the problem and that the blame was lifted for her health problems but devastated that it would only get worse and the hassle would continue.  </p>

<p>“I do realise that PCOS is not the end of the world [but] there is a medical reason as to why I have never felt like a real woman and could not imagine a future in which I would live a normal life,” Besma says. </p>
