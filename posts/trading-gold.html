	<p> <b> The history of the price of gold </b> </p>
   
  <p> Looking at the price of gold throughout history can offer a good indication of the trends in gold price, and can help with forecasting future prices. The price of gold tends to rise during periods of uncertainty on the stock market, making it the perfect <a href="https://www.ig.com/uk/investments/news/investing/2017/12/11/how-to-invest-in-gold-41091">'safe haven' investment.</a>  This explains why gold has historically performed best in times of economic downturn, reaching an all-time high of Â£1,125.60 per ounce in September 2011, amidst the global financial recession. Therefore, if you are trying to determine the optimal time to buy and sell gold, it is vital to consider past trends in gold prices.   </p>
		 
 <p> <b> What determines gold prices? </b> </p>
 <p> Whilst the status of stock markets is a significant driver of the price of gold, there are other factors which influence price. High interest rates can often make owning gold less appealing, leading to a fall in price, whereas geopolitical tensions can cause a rise in the price of gold, with investors feeling the same anxiety in these periods as in times of economic uncertainty. Other factors include a weakened dollar, which can increase demand for buyers in other currencies, and the growth of many Asian economies has seen an increased demand for Gold for jewellery making, which can boost the price worldwide. As there are so many determinants of the price of gold, the market can fluctuate fairly significantly. It may then be wise to consider whether your preference is for swing-trading or investing based on long-term trends.   </p>
  
 <p><b> How should you trade? </b></p>
 <p> Regardless of whether your intent is to trade short-term or long-term, it is important to weigh up the best trading options for you. The options for trading gold are trading physical gold or trading gold price movements, either with exchange-traded funds or a contract for difference. Physical gold requires storage, and paying a broker or firm a storage fee can take away from future profits. If you are more interested in speculation, then ETFs or CFDs may be a better fit. With both these trading methods, you are buying gold based on its monetary value rather than weight. One of the things you should consider when deciding between the two is whether you are looking for a long-term or short-term investment. If you would rather the former, then an ETF may be better suited, and a CFD would be preferable for the latter. However, the differences are not only related to the longevity of your investment. CFDs offer investors leverage of around 20 times the amount of their deposit, which provides the opportunity to make profits on a higher value of security than is bought. Additionally, with CFDs traders can make profits regardless of whether the price is rising or falling, as long as their predictions are accurate. </p>
