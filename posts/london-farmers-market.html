	<p> The London Farmers’ Market will be celebrating its 20th anniversary on Saturday 30th June at Islington Farmers’ Market. The event promises to be a real celebration of the anniversary with entertainment from the London School of Samba and the Union Chapel Singers. </p>
  
  <p> The MP for Islington South, Emily Thornberry, will be in attendance for the cake cutting ceremony. </p>
  
  <p> To celebrate 20 years, I spoke to David Derne of Chegworth Valley, a producer from Maidstone, Kent who has been a vendor since the first London Farmers’ Market. </p>
  
  <p> Speaking of the change in the market over 20 years, he said: “People are more aware of farmers and local produce coming directly from the farmer now.” Changes in consumer habits has meant that “consumers understand that fruit and veg doesn’t have be all glossy and perfect like in the supermarket. It’s still perfectly good produce.” </p>
  
  <p> A rise in demand has led to a rise in farmers’ markets and Derne spoke of the strain that can cause: “Some markets are diluted a bit now thought. They are not as profitable as 20 years ago.” </p>
  
  <p> Despite this change, Brexit does not appear be placing an imminent threat on those kinds of events. Derne said, “people may be watching their money more but there is no clear change as of yet.” </p>
  
  <p> Chegworth Valley, along with many other local vendors, will be in attendance this Saturday. </p>
