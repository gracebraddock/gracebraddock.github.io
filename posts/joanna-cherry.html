  After failing to garner enough support in Parliament to revoke Article 50 through the indicative votes process last month, Joanna Cherry has set her sights on Scottish independence.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Cherry drew criticism after the indicative votes for appearing to mouth ‘f***king Labour’ after her motion lost by 109 votes. Discussing her disappointment, Cherry said: “if Labour had supported my motion it would have passed… Jeremy Corbyn is sitting on the fence”.
  </p>

  The Edinburgh South West MP made clear that her ‘red line’ for Brexit is that “there must be a second referendum”. However, she acknowledged that “in Parliament, there does not seem to be a majority [for a People’s Vote]”, which she believes only strengthens the case for Scottish independence. She said: “We need a second referendum because something fundamental has changed – Scotland voted to remain in the EU and our democratic decision has been snubbed by Westminster”. She went on to add: “Westminster Parliament and the UK Government rides roughshod over the wishes of the Scottish people”.
  </p>

  A recent YouGov poll suggests support for Cherry’s claim that there is a “growing number of Scots” who want independence, with the ‘yes’ side rising to 49%, its highest polling since February 2015. However, this still doesn’t give Scottish Nationalists the majority.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Regardless, Cherry remains confident that support for independence will grow further, stating: “if the UK Government will not agree to a second independence referendum that will only increase support for independence and throw the UK political system into greater chaos”. 
  </p>

  Looking towards the future of Scottish independence or increased devolution, the MP expressed desires for Scotland to “take control of immigration devolved” adding that “an entrance based policy that benefits Scotland’s economy and society” is of high importance.
  </p>

  With an indyref2 ‘framework’ bill being published in Holyrood at the end of May, the SNP are readying for a real fight to secure another shot at independence. However, according to the BBC: “Nicola Sturgeon has no intention of going ahead with an independence referendum that has not been authorised by Westminster” and with all the candidates of the Conservative leadership contest in agreement that there will be no second independence referendum, it looks like a long road ahead for the SNP.
