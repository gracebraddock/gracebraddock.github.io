    <h1>#TakeAKnee Proves That American Patriotism is Nothing More Than White Supremacy</h1><p>
    Trumps condemnation of the NFL players who kneeled in protest against police brutality and racial injustice during the national anthem highlight just how skewed America’s priorities are. For the president to show more outrage towards men peacefully protesting inequality than towards neo-nazi violence in Charlottesville, it is clear that he defines disrespect of the country as the challenging of white supremacy. Just the contrast in his language towards the two events show the extreme disparity in his perception of both groups of people. Whilst he labelled predominantly black NFL players as “sons of bitches” he said of Unite the Right, the Charlottesville protesters, “But you also had people that were very fine people” and “the press has treated them absolutely unfairly”. So in Trump’s eyes, the documentation of a violent rally fighting for confederate symbols and white supremacy which resulted in the death of one and injury of 33 others was unfair? There is only one explanation for his responses. White supremacy is less offensive to him than black men exercising their right to protest gross inequality.

Trump called for the dismissal of any player who knelt during the national anthem, but tip-toed around the subject of the alt-right at Charlottesville. In defence of his comments on the NFL, Trump said “they’re not respecting our country”. I wonder what he could possibly mean by “our country”? American men in the streets waving swastikas and chanting “blood and soil”, the famous Nazi chant isn’t disrespecting the country? I thought America prided itself on defeating Nazism? It seems like it doesn’t matter how people protest in America, as long as it doesn’t challenge American patriotism, which now more than ever, is being exposed as white supremacy.

No level of outrage has ever come from Trump surrounding police brutality, or the disproportionate number of incarcerated African Americans as a percentage of their population or racially motivated violence at the hands of white people. None of that angers Trump because none of it undermines him, none of it challenges him directly or threatens him. Black men, prominent black men with a significant platform, protesting these things threaten him because they aim to tackle white supremacy. Trump’s reaction was nothing more than an overshadowing of the message. By calling these men disrespectful to their nation, to undermine their message by making it about lack of patriotism, disrespect for their peers and their servicemen their movement for social justice was carved into a discussion about national pride. Their message was stopped in its tracks, turned on its head and rewritten to villainise their actions rather than addressed within the wider narrative of American society. That was Trump’s goal here, he has no interest in tackling the issues POC face within America so instead he villainises their movement to extinguish any momentum their statement might generate. 
</p><p>
Trump isn’t threatened by white supremacists rallying in the streets, and although his failure to denounce them exposes him as the white supremacist he is, it’s not a threat. It’s not a threat for Trump to be exposed as a white supremacist, it’s a threat when people challenge white supremacy. He won authority and power off the back of fear mongering and division, white supremacy is the reason he is in the white house. He benefits nothing from denouncing white supremacy and he loses nothing by being known as a white supremacist. He only loses power when people protest for change that he will never provide. He only feels threatened by protest that aims to provide equality and challenge the white supremacy that got him into the position he’s in. 
</p><p>
This whole NFL narrative has been dominated by Trump and his desire to undermine the powerful message that the players are trying to spread. That’s why it’s important to focus on the individual players and their work for social justice and improvement.

Russell Wilson led the decision for his team, the Seattle Seahawks, to remain in the locker room during the national anthem. He founded the Why Not You foundation in 2014 to empower and inspire change in people, he also regularly visits Seattle Children’s Hospital to which he donated more than $1 million in 2016. Furthermore, in 2012 proceeds from another of his foundations, The Russell Wilson Passing Academy, went to Charles Ray III Diabetes Association

Devin McCourty knelt during the national anthem in response to Trump’s comments and refused an invitation to the White House in April when his team, The Patriots, were honoured. McCourty and his twin brother host a kids' football skills camp in New York each summer. They are also ambassadors for the United Way of America which fights for the health, education, and financial stability of every person in every community and the NFL's Fuel Up to Play 60 program promoting healthy lifestyles for children.

Denver Broncos’ player Brandon Marshall was the third NFL player to kneel in protest of social injustice. After joining the movement, he met with Denver police chief Robert White to discuss law enforcement, police brutality incidents and training methods. Marshall also offered suggestions as to how the police department can assist with social change and fighting racial injustices locally and beyond. He’s worked with the Rose Andom Center which tackles domestic violence and in a post on his Instagram page in September 2016 he pledged to donate $300 for every tackle he made to organizations in Denver that address “critical social issues.” Finally, for the past two years Marshall has organized an Attendance Challenge at local elementary schools, encouraging kids to go to school, learn and use their education.

Colin Kaepernick is the figure who started the movement within the NFL in 2016. His philanthropy is extensive, with donations of $25,000 to DREAM, which provides after-school activities and sports opportunities to New York youth; Coalition for the Homeless; The Gathering for Justice's War on Children, a program meant to reduce child incarceration that will launch next year; and United We Dream, which advocates for the dignity and fair treatment of immigrant youth and families. He also donated a further $50,000 to meals on wheels, $50,000 to health clinics at Standing Rock and $25,000 towards paying rent for US veterans facing eviction, and providing employment training programs for people who served in military uniform.

But Donald Trump is right, these men are disrespectful to American values. They aim to improve the lives of vulnerable and disadvantaged people, whilst American patriotism aims to reinforce white supremacy.
