    <h1>Man vs Woman - The Gender's Brains are Wired Differently</h1>
    <p>
    A recent study has shown evidence that suggests that Men and Women's brains are connected in different ways.
</p><p>
The study carried out at the University of Pennsylvania scanned the brains of almost 1000 men, women, boys and girls.
</p><p>
 The research shows great differences between the two sexes as women's brains seemed to be wired left to right crossing across both sides of the brain over the groove. However, males’ brains were wired front to back with very few connections over the two hemispheres.
</p><p>
Scientists from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) believe that this is why men and women are better at different tasks. Men's brains are wired up so they are better at learning and performing a single task such as learning to drive or map reading whereas women’s brains are connected so they are more skilful at multitasking.

Contrary to this analysis some experts have argued it isn't that simple. Brain connections can change throughout one’s lifespan so it is a huge inference to conclude that the behavioural variation between the sexes is down to those differences.
