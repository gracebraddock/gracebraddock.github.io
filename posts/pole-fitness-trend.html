<h1> Pole Fitness: The new 'it' fitness that is more than just a trend </h1>

<p>As I try to muster the momentum to thrust both my thighs around a sweaty pole leaving me with the same sensation as sliding skin exposed down carpeted stairs, I wonder why anyone would come back for a second pole fitness session. </p>

<p>But as I picture back to my arrival at London Dance Academy (LDA), with a corridor full of women; some in full gym gear and some in nothing more than skimpy underwear, I’m reminded that this is no ordinary fitness class. </p>
 
<p>Why am I here? Well, as someone with terrible upper body strength and a tendency to find exercise boring, I wanted to find out whether pole fitness could be the unconventional workout I needed. </p>

<p>Someone who has found their quirky fitness fix in pole is Becca. She started pole fitness a year ago following a breakup, which gave her the push to try something new. “Some people go for the strength and fitness side of it and some people like the more erotic side of it. Everyone goes for different reasons,” Becca said. </p>

<p>No matter the reason for trying out pole, it’s certainly not easy. I wobbled my way through the basic warm up of lunges and stretches, struggling to coordinate and keep in time with the instructor’s orders, given with a voice you’d expect to hear in a guided meditation. This was the first time I thought I may have made a mistake. </p>

<p>Despite my concerns about my upper body strength (or lack of) it was actually the anticipation of pain that was the bigger hurdle. Usually in sports pain is an indicator to stop but in pole you have to tune it out or you’ll spend the entire session bottling the moves. </p>

<p>This will leave you feeling like a lemon as you look around the room of women who are recording their graceful spins for Instagram or making it look so easy they suspend themselves mid-air sitting on the pole. </p>

<p>However, there is a sense of bonding that comes with making a fool out of yourself in front of a room full of strangers. During my failed attempts at the fireman’s spin I found myself catching the eye of another girl and we both chuckled at my ineptitude. </p>

<p>Not everyone was as comfortable with the difficulty of pole though as one girl sat out her turn as much as she could before quietly collecting her belongings and sneaking out mid class. </p>

<p>The walkout was not alone in finding the session difficult. Sarah, a second time attendee, has found the technical dance side of it harder than expected. “I’m not very girly so I feel like I haven’t got much grace. I like the fitness side and the strength side but I’m bad with co-ordination so it takes me ages to get the technique.” </p>


<p>According to Melissa Gray, the director and co-founder of London Dance Academy (LDA), “pole dancing is much more sporty, tricks and technique based now”. </p>

<p>Pole first started being taught as a form of fitness in the 90s and since the mid-2000s pole fitness classes have become more and more mainstream. Recognition of pole as a sport has increased since the rise of pole dancing competitions and championships and it could even be an Olympic sport in the next decade. </p>

<p>The perception of pole dancing has been changing in recent years. However, rather than encouraging mixed sessions, LDA offers classes exclusively for men run by a male instructor. In these classes the choreography element is removed to focus on the strength and tricks, suggesting that traditional pole fitness is still seen as too raunchy. </p> 

<p>The problem of pole being misunderstood seems to be confirmed by the instructor Sophie who turns down my request for an interview saying, “there’s just a lot of politics in pole”. </p>

<p>Gray has admitted that in the earlier days they had their “fair share of people thinking [they] were strippers and judging accordingly”. </p>

<p>“We did teach some of the girls from the big strip clubs too, but there’s nothing wrong with that.” </p>

<p>In fairness, I wasn’t expecting the class to be so routine based. We focused on three moves (pivot, pirouette, and fireman’s spin) with only the fireman’s spin involving any heavy lifting. However, that was more than enough to leave my thighs burning with every step the following day and my arms still sore three days later. </p>

<p>Sophie prioritised one-on-one feedback, directing me back to a pole during one of my breaks to check my technique for the fireman’s spin. “Legs are great but your left arm is too high so you’re not pushing yourself away from the pole enough,” she informed me. </p>

<p>Immediately after the class I felt like I’d had a good workout and I felt well stretched. It was also a pleasant surprise to wake up to no bruising on my legs the next day. Once the skin burn subsided I even found myself thinking I could hack a couple more sessions.  </p>

<p>While attitudes are changing towards pole and people are becoming more attuned to the health benefits, there is no shame in the erotic side of pole that many enjoy. </p>

<p>LDA has no desire to shy away from this either, as Gray has pointed out. “We have recently seen the Classique and Exotic styles making a comeback – it always does eventually!” </p>

<p>“It’s a wonderful way to feel confident and take hold of your own sexuality.” </p>
