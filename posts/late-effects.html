<h1> The debilitating legacy of radiotherapy treatment </h1>

<p><i>Approximately 50% of cancer patients receive radiotherapy as part of their treatment but many are living with little-known downsides decades later.  </i></p>

<p>Cancer treatments are known for their brutal side effects but nobody expects to be suffering side effects years down the line. However, that’s the reality for thousands of childhood cancer survivors who are suffering with late effects of radiation decades after getting the all clear. </p>

<p>Liz Brown, 44, was treated with radiation therapy when she was 14 for an aggressive osteoblastoma of the spine. She suffered some moderate side effects at the time but now says, “it’s the treatment that saved my life that’s now trying to kill me”. </p>

<p>In the last five years Liz has had ten skin cancers (basal cell carcinomas), has developed radiation fibrosis syndrome which restricts the mobility of her right arm and neck, had two tumours removed from her lung and is experiencing tooth decay caused by a change in the acidity of her saliva – all the result of the radiation treatment she received in 1989.</p>

<p>Despite suffering such severe late effects, the lack of awareness surrounding the issue left Liz having to fight for the link between her symptoms and her treatment to be taken seriously.  “When I’d spoken to the dermatologist [about my skin cancers] I said ‘will this have anything to do with the radiotherapy I had?’ and he said ‘no don’t be silly you didn’t have radiation in the days of Florence Nightingale, radiotherapy doesn’t do things like that’.”</p>

<p>“I fought and fought to get listened to… I became an expert in it and yet doctors were telling me I was wrong and I knew I was right but it was making me doubt myself.”</p>

<p>The dismissive response of doctors is largely down to the lack of knowledge of late effects outside of specialist medical circles. </p>

<p>However, after two years of push back Liz was finally referred to a specialist consultant three years ago when she moved to Hull and she is now monitored closely for any changes. </p>

<p>Although there is very little awareness of late effects, they are incredibly common for cancer survivors. According to Dr Amanda Walker, a radiation oncologist in Washington: “Nearly everyone who is alive years after radiation therapy will experience a late effect at some point.” </p>

<p>“Some late effects are completely asymptomatic, for example, slight cosmetic changes… Others can be severely debilitating such as difficulty swallowing after head and neck radiation, which may require a feeding tube.” </p>

<p>The risk of life debilitating late effects is also higher than researchers initially predicted. Mike Hawkins set up the British Childhood Cancer Survivor Study in the 1980s. Speaking about research conducted into premature mortality in survivors of childhood cancer, he said, “by 50 years [since] diagnosis you’d expect 6% to have died, in fact 30% have died. That’s made up of 12% dying of their original cancer coming back and 18% dying of other causes… so enormous premature mortality.” </p>

<p> The most common late effects that cause premature deaths are new cancers, which make up half of the deaths that occur over 45 years post-diagnosis, while circulatory issues which cause heart attacks and strokes make up a quarter. </p>

<p>Jennifer Warden, 56, is one of many cancer survivors who has dealt with cardiac problems caused by radiation. After receiving radiotherapy to the chest for Hodgkin’s Lymphoma in 1985, Jennifer has since been diagnosed with heart disease which left her needing open heart surgery to replace a blocked artery in 2017. </p>

<p>Jennifer was fortunate not to have her experience of late effects dismissed saying, “they knew as soon as they knew my history and knew I’d had radiation [that it was linked to the treatment].” </p>

<p>“The narrowing of my arteries was all in the radiation field and outside of the radiation field it all looked just fine so that was kind of the clincher.” </p>

<p>“Over the years I’ve made some friends that [also had] Hodgkins and almost every one of them that had radiation around the time that I did has had heart disease,” Jennifer told me,  later confirming that three of her friends are now in heart failure. </p> 

<p>Jennifer’s recovery from heart surgery was not plain sailing but she is now living a functional life and is being followed more carefully for any further complications. </p>

<p>However, not everyone is able to carry on with life as usual as a result of their late effects. Liz Brown, who worked as a special educational needs teaching assistant spoke of the strain of her late effects. “It started off quite small… and then about three years ago I woke up and I’d lost feeling in all parts of my arm, that was when it started to go downhill because I ended up being medically dismissed from work so I lost my career.” </p>

<p>“It’s becoming a huge issue because more and more people are surviving, and I’d say we’ve got another ten years of people coming through that are going to have horrific, life changing issues from the treatment that saved their lives,” Liz says. </p>

<p>Liz has now turned her attention to raising awareness of late effects. “Late effects need awareness not fear.”</p>

<p>“I know it’s frightening to turn around and say to somebody that you are actually at high risk of having further cancer but if they’re aware of it they can be monitored.”</p>

<p>The risk of developing late effects is expected to be lower for those receiving treatment presently compared with two to three decades ago as treatments are much more targeted now. Additionally, the biggest risk factor for developing late effects is dosage so medical professionals are trying to treat with lower doses so there is the same impact in terms of cure but lower impact in terms of toxicity. </p>

<p>While the future looks more promising for current childhood cancer survivors there are still many who received treatment decades ago who are unaware of the legacy of their cancer treatment. </p>

<p>“People need to know that childhood cancer survivors are walking around with literal time bombs inside of them,” Liz says. </p>

<p>One of the main causes for poor monitoring of childhood cancer survivors is the lack of awareness about late effects. Jennifer believes that pressures from cancer organisations, medical professionals and patients have led to this lack of discussion. “I think the whole cancer community only want to talk about the positives and there’s a lot projected on [cancer patients] to be constantly grateful for their survival and I really think [the cancer community] just don’t want to talk about anything that’s negative.” </p>

<p>Survivor studies have helped inform the medical community of the long term impacts of cancer treatments and new research is being presented regularly. For example these studies have shown that patients that were irradiated in the pelvic or lower abdominal area for illnesses such as kidney cancer are particularly vulnerable to developing bowel cancer. </p>

<p>“We’ve known for decades that bowel cancer runs in families and if you have two first degree relatives that have bowel cancer you have a heightened risk of bowel cancer. But these people that have had their bowel irradiated as part of their cancer treatment, their risk of bowel cancer is even higher,” Mike Hawkins told me. </p>

<p>Now a group called the International Guidelines Harmonisation Group has been set up to try and outline worldwide surveillance guidelines for following up on late effects.  </p>

<p>This is an issue that has only become apparent as survivor rates have increased and people are living longer post-treatment. In 2018 the 5-year survival rate for child cancer patients was 85.5% compared with 66% 30 years prior. There have been similar changes in the 5-year survival rate for survivors of teenage and young adult cancer. </p>

<p>Liz Brown has been told there is nothing that can be done to stop her late effects but she maintains a positive outlook despite facing such adversity. “If people can learn from me then that means there’s a good reason for all of this.” </p>
