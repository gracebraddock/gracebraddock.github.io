    <h1>BBC Radio 4’s Justin Webb Discusses the Future of Journalism: "we’ve got to find a way of paying for it"</h1>

	<p>
  With ad-revenue dwindling and a decline in brand loyalty, how are publications
supposed to survive? Justin Webb, the host of BBC Radio 4’s Today
programme, believes the future of journalism depends on finding a method of
paying for it in the digital age.
  <\p>
  
  <p>
  With the Guardian requesting donations in order to continue without paywalls,
and reports of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/05/the-sun-losses-advertising-hacking-charges-profits-revenues">£60m loss in profits</a> for the Sun in 2016, all news publications
are finding it hard to survive in the digital era. Webb questioned the
practicality of consuming digital news, asking: “I’m reading and I’m not paying
anything at all for that. How does that work?”

  <p>
  It’s not just the future of accessing journalism that is a concern to Webb. He
spoke of the future of journalism as a career, saying: “I think the difficulty for
the people starting in journalism now [is] these long internships where you’re
not getting paid much.”
  </p>
  
  <p>
  “There is an element of exploitation, there’s no question about that,” he
added.
  </p>

  Whilst pay remains a concern for aspiring journalists, Webb was careful not to
deter those passionate in pursuing the career, saying: “If you’re really keen to
do it you’ve got to put that to one side and just have a go and see what
happens.”
  </p>
  
  <p>
  However, Webb is confident that there is a “real desire” for “proper
journalism” which will secure the future of the profession. He places emphasis
on the need for investigative journalism stating: “Look at that Financial Times
story about the all-men dinner in London. That kind of work, that kind of effort
[shows] there is a desire for it to happen and for it to be done properly and for
it to be truthful.”
  </p>

  Webb is hopeful that the Financial Times’ decision to lift their paywall on that
article will encourage readers to recognise the importance of “that sort of
journalism”, urging them to recognise that “if you’re going to carry on having it
in the future, we’ve got to find a way of paying for it.”
