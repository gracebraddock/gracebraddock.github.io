<h1>London on track for highest rates of knife crime in almost a decade </h1>

<p>London is on track for its worst year for knife crime in almost a decade, with over a quarter of knife crime in London taking place in just five boroughs. </p>

<p>Data from the Met Police shows there have been 12,668 knife related crimes between January 2019 and October 2019 compared with 12,197 for the same period last year. </p>

<p>Knife crime in Westminster, Haringey, Southwark, Hackney, and Enfield made up 28% of knife crime in London this year. </p>

<p>This figure follows reports of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/crosslom-bis-davis-harlem-spartans-dead-drill-rap-stabbed-london-a9237311.html">12 hours of bloodshed in London last week </a>that saw three fatal stabbings, with a 22-year-old male being killed in Hackney. </p>

<p>Last year had the highest rates of knife crime recorded since 2010 but 2019 is set to overtake that number, with the death toll for this year already <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/12/05/london-murders-2019-violent-killings-capital-highest-level-decade/">surpassing the 2018 figure</a>.</p>

<p>As well as this year looking to be the worst for knife crime, April 2019 saw the highest number of knife related crimes since April 2010. </p>

<p>This record may extend past a nine-year high, as public data prior to April 2010 is unavailable. </p>

<p>These stats come amid Cressida Dick, the head of Scotland Yard saying in March that knife crime is the <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/knife-crime-is-worst-i-ve-seen-says-police-chief-7pl6c23wk">worst she has seen </a>and that there is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-47452799">“some link” </a>between falling police numbers and increased violent crime. </p>

<p>Westminster, Haringey, Hackney and Southwark also top the list for the highest numbers of knife crime per 10,000 people. </p>

<p>Haringey council responded to this saying: “Overall violence with injury has started to improve in Haringey, although robbery levels – which are linked to the increase in total knife crime – continue to escalate, and are a contributing factor to violence.” </p>

<p>The council added: “Knife crime is clustered geographically in Haringey, with partnership work being targeted in key hotspots in the borough.” </p>

<p>Westminster council have also attributed knife crime to the rise in robbery offences, with the council’s own research showing that there has been a <a href="https://committees.westminster.gov.uk/documents/s33801/6. CMPP Knife Crime 100919 - Master 002.pdf">60% increase in robbery offences </a>last year and according to the council “robbery is a key driver of knife crime”. </p>

<p>Westminster frequently sees the worst rates for knife crime, with <a href="https://committees.westminster.gov.uk/documents/s33801/6. CMPP Knife Crime 100919 - Master 002.pdf">hotspots in the West End and Hyde Park</a>. </p>
