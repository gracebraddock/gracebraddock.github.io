    <h1>Platform’s SUTCO/SUPAS Swap-Over Raises Over £135 for Cavendish Cancer Care</h1>
	<p><b><i>This article appeared on the Forge Today <a href="http://forgetoday.com/news/2017/11/10/platforms-sutcosupas-swap-over-raises-over-135-for-cavendish-cancer-care/">website</a>.</b></i></p>

On November 8th SUTCO and SUPAS came together again for the 6th year alongside Platform society to raise money for Sheffield’s own Cavendish Cancer Care.  </p>
  
	<p>
The two societies stepped outside of their comfort zones, writing scripts for each other with only one day to prepare for their performances, all in the name of charity.

  </p>
  
	<p>
The event successfully raised £137.40 for Cavendish Cancer Care, who apart from some limited government funding enough for two weeks care, relies solely on fundraising efforts.

  </p>
  
	<p>
The event is headed by Platform society, who collaborate with other societies to raise money for Cavendish Cancer Care. They organise around 4 mini events like the SUTCO/SUPAS swap over a semester as well as holding a 3-day festival in March. Last year they raised nearly £4500 for Cavendish Cancer Care, which supports both those suffering with cancer and their loved ones.

Jessie Romain, President of Platform said of the yearly swap over, “There is typically a lot of light mockery of each other and it’s a great laugh!”

  </p>

Beth Dawson, Show Publicist at SUTCO, described the event as “a chance to make fun of both our own societies, whilst integrating things from past shows – both our own productions and stuff that you would find on The West End or Broadway – with the occasional nod to a Disney film or two”

She went on to joke, “I have to say my rendition of Mulan’s ‘I’ll make a man out of you’ featuring a kid’s scooter was really a sight to behold.”
