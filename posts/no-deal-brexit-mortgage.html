    <h1>How Will a No-Deal Brexit Impact Your Mortgage?  </h1>
	<p><b><i>This article was written for <a href="https://charcol.co.uk">charcol.co.uk</a> </b></i></p>		

	<p> The threat of a no-deal Brexit has left us all wondering what the effects will be. This week the Bank of England announced they were maintaining current interest rates due to Brexit uncertainty and credit rating agency Moodyâ€™s suggested that a no-deal Brexit could lead to a recession. With the possibility of a no-deal Brexit seeming more likely every day, we breakdown what this could mean for your mortgage.  </p>
   
  <p> A no-deal Brexit would likely result in a significant decline in the value of the pound, meaning higher inflation but a squeeze on real wages. As bad as this sounds, with the Bank of England currently sustaining interest rates at 0.75% there may be little impact on UK mortgages. However, in the past higher inflation has led to higher interest rates which means those on a fixed rate mortgage may be better protected from the risks of a no-deal Brexit.   </p>
		 
  <p> Foreign currency mortgages would be dramatically impacted if the British pound was to fall. If you are a homeowner in Europe with a variable rate sterling mortgage you would be at an advantage, as a fall in the value of the pound against the euro would drive down the cost of your mortgage. However, if your mortgage is in euros you may want to consider other options if the risk of a no-deal Brexit increases further.   </p>
  
  <p> Choosing the right mortgage can be stressful and with the added pressure of the financial uncertainty of Brexit we understand that you might need professional reassurance. If you are concerned about the future of your mortgage you should contact an independent mortgage broker who can assess and discuss your possible options.
