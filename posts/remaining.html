    <h1>I'm a Remainer, but Remaining is a Terrible Idea</h1>
	<p><b><i>This article was posted on the 30th of March 2019</b></i></p>

  I voted remain in the 2016 referendum, I would still love to remain (albeit mainly for selfish reasons) and as a petty person, nothing would be more satisfying than seeing the smiles wiped off the faces of the wealthy disaster capitalists who are banking on a no deal Brexit for their own greed. However, remaining now – after three years of the most divided times in modern British politics – would fix nothing and only create further divisions and anger.

  I think there is a level of arrogance amongst remain voters, especially the ones calling for a People’s Vote and for Article 50 to be revoked. Essentially, we (because yes, I am included in this arrogance) see the disaster that is the Brexit negotiations as proof that there is no better deal than the one we already have, and we are dumbfounded by the idea that anyone could genuinely support Brexit after seeing what a mess it’s creating. But, in reality, we were never going to view Brexit positively. The fact that there were calls for a People’s Vote with remain on the ballot before there were even leave options in place suggests that even with a soft Brexit deal to appease remainers, there would still be people campaigning to remain.

  In fact, the only other petition to gain the same sort of traction as the current Revoke Article 50 petition is one that was signed by over 4 million people in the aftermath of the referendum. This petition called for a second referendum if the winning side won less than 60% of the vote with a turnout under 75%. So the declaration that the People’s Vote is just about giving the people a final say is categorically false. They are campaigning because they truly believe remain would win this time, which according to polls may be the case, but according to the polls we were supposed to win last time. So then what happens if the public votes for no deal? Do we say we can’t accept that because the general population aren’t qualified enough to make that decision? The People’s Vote is and always has been about putting a stop to Brexit.

  The reason I don’t believe remaining is a good idea is that it will just cause more problems. Economically speaking, staying in the EU makes the most sense. However, that won’t mean much to the communities who have already been left behind in times when the UK’s economy was supposedly booming. Granted, that is the fault of the government not the EU, but that doesn’t change the fact that remaining isn’t going to fix these communities problems either. Remaining is now a short-term solution that resolves none of the long-term problems that resulted in people voting leave in the first place. Problems that have been systematically ignored for decades. Ignoring these communities once again will only fuel the fires of resentment and anger, and in fairness that resentment will be completely justified. Yes the Vote Leave campaign committed electoral fraud, yes the referendum result wasn’t legally binding, and yes there were a lot of lies told by politicians who wanted leave to win. However, none of this changes the fact that even if remain were to win in another referendum, there would be an enormous feeling of betrayal from leavers who never had the result they voted for implemented in any manner.

  Some remainers seem to believe the fantasy that remaining will solve all of our problems, and we’ll somehow be able to ignore the last three years and get back to sorting out our schools or the NHS. This couldn’t be more of an insult, not just to leave voters, but to all of the people that have been gravely neglected by the government due to virtually all our time and money being spent on Brexit. Their suffering will have been all for nothing. Furthermore, this won’t be a generational problem that will die off in a few years. The government, anyone in parliament complicit in ending Brexit, and remain voters will be held in contempt by a whole section of society for decades. There will be a complete breakdown of trust in the main political parties, which will open up the political playing field for more fringe groups to breakthrough. Many think we’re going to turn into America 2.0 if we leave but remaining would facilitate the growth of populism and could see us being led by a Trump-esque figure promising our departure from the EU. So essentially, we still leave except we now have the far right to deal with as well, yay!

  The majority of people calling for the reversal of Brexit are middle class neoliberals who use the excuse that Brexit will destroy our country, cost jobs, and exacerbate the already growing poverty in our society. But if they care so much about those issues then why is this the only time they’ve made real noise about them? According to organisers, the People’s Vote march last weekend attracted an estimated 1 million people. Where are the protests against rising poverty or homelessness? A march against funding cuts to the NHS had only 40,000 demonstrators in June 2018, not even 5% of the turnout for the People’s Vote march. The reality of why the turnout was so much higher is because this is one of the first times that the people campaigning are directly negatively affected by a political policy. There’s nothing wrong with being more outspoken against issues that have direct consequences for you, but don’t be disingenuous and make this about the good of the country, because at this point in time remaining is the worst possible solution for healing the wounds of a divided country.
