    <h1>Uber’s Future in Sheffield in Jeopardy After Suspension of License</h1>
	<p><b><i>This article appeared on the Forge Today <a href="http://forgetoday.com/news/2017/12/07/ubers-future-in-sheffield-in-jeopardy-after-suspension-of-license/">website</a>.</b></i></p>

Uber’s licence to operate in Sheffield will be suspended from 18th December after the company failed to provide information requested by Sheffield City Council about their management.

  </p>
  
	<p>
The taxi service app has responded to say the suspension is down to an “administrative error”, noting that their application for a new license was submitted on October 16th and is yet to be fully processed.

  </p>
  
	<p>
A spokesperson for Uber stated, “While we are in regular contact with the council, we did not receive the correspondence the council refers to as they sent the letters to an incorrect address”.

  </p>
  
	<p>
The company are getting ready to challenge the suspension if the application they submitted cannot be processed. If not processed Uber faces the risk of being out of operation over the Christmas period.

  </p>

Uber are legally allowed to operate until the December 18th and if an appeal is submitted, the company can remain in business until the appeal is finalised.
