    <h1>Freedom of Speech</h1>
    <p> Freedom of Speech, the Catch-22 of Human Rights Acts. It allows people freedom, but Freedom of Speech can compromise another’s freedom of life. One of the biggest questions of today’s society is “should there be a line distinguished in Freedom of Speech?” With a society composed on social progression and inclusion, and speech regularly falling under the category of hate crime, how free is freedom of speech? Is there a place for freedom of speech? The answer is, I don’t know. 
 </p>
    <p> Contrary to popular belief, language is humans’ most powerful and dangerous tool. Yes, we have weapons of mass destruction, but their use will always be dictated by language. Language has formed the biggest institutions within society, concepts such as religion would cease to exist without the power of language, the power to persuade one with words and their precise ordering. Every ideology in the world, every opinion one ever has, every action one ever makes is shaped by the language we have heard in our lifetime. We are not completely powerless to it, certain people are more influenced by certain language than others, but ultimately every inequality in the world can be brought back to language. 
 </p>
    <p> Language is knowledge but it is also limitation. It gives people the ability to teach others for growth but also to teach others to remain where they are. The population of the western world are taught that the structure of our society is inflexible, the structures and institutions unbreakable. We are taught that we will never achieve real change because “that’s just the way the world works”. We are taught to accept and remain passive, and we are taught this with language. 
 </p>
    <p> Language tarnished with hate has been able to control and influence for centuries. Worldwide we are taught who is superior and who is inferior, who is the enemy and who we should blame. This seems more prevalent than ever with the attitudes in society towards Islam and a correlation with terrorism and the increased narrative of walls up rather than arms open. Language has been used consistently throughout history to demonise particular groups in society. I believe in the freedom of speech but I also recognise the gross power language has, to inform the minds of the masses and to place emphasis on language of hate. Giving hateful language such a dominant platform in society is detrimental to all human life. Are we forgetting that the largest genocides of human life have been at the hands of individuals who have spouted their hateful language, and managed to demonise certain individuals to the point of dehumanisation? How century after century leaders have managed to reign with language of fear rather than language of love and acceptance is beyond me. </p>
    <p> Should the use of certain language be penalised as a hate crime? I don’t know. It should definitely be acknowledged as hateful, it shouldn’t be promoted with a platform, it shouldn’t be given the opportunity of profit, but I don’t know if it should be penalised. 
 </p>
    <p> That said, the mass destruction at the hands of language makes me question if freedom of speech is the biggest crime of them all.
