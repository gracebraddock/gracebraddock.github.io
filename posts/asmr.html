    <h1>From Niche YouTube Videos to Ground-breaking Research in Sheffield: The Rise of ASMR </h1><p>
    From a young age, I loved soft spoken stories or classroom games where a peer would gently trace words and pictures on your back. They would send me into a complete state of relaxation which was often accompanied by a pleasant tingling sensation that shimmied through my body. In a bid to beat a bout of insomnia, I used YouTube to find relaxing voices and I stumbled across ‘the whisper community’. In 2010, after the coining of the term ASMR by Jennifer Allen, an acronym that stands for Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response, whisper videos turned into ASMR videos, and the phenomenon was born. 
</p><p>
ASMR is the term associated with experiencing tingles throughout the body, commonly triggered by gentle or repetitive movements and/or an array of soft sounds. The tingles often begin in the head and spread to the back of the neck and down the spine, in varying intensities dependent on the trigger and the individual. However, some fans of ASMR don’t experience tingles at all. They instead enjoy the videos for relaxation or a solution to insomnia. 
</p><p>
ASMR has garnered growing media attention since 2010, and particularly since 2016 it has received a huge increase in attention on YouTube. Since July 2016 W Magazine have ran an ASMR series on their YouTube channel, where they get well-known faces to have a go at triggering ASMR. 
</p><p>
Big YouTube channels such as FBE who have over 16 million subscribers, have done reaction videos to popular ASMR videos which has undeniably helped the community to grow. Notably, GentleWhispering, a key “ASMRtist” (a term used within the community) was the first ASMR channel to reach the 1 million subscriber milestone in July 2017. 
</p><p>
Ikea took it to new extremes recently by releasing an online ASMR advert, where different items were advertised using ASMR techniques like soft speaking and the scratching and tapping of surfaces such as bed sheets, desks and carpet. 
</p><p>
With ASMR gaining significant attention, not all attention is going to be positive. ASMR videos are unique in that they usually talk directly to the viewer and treat the viewer as if they are in a one on one situation. Everyday life scenarios, like going to the hairdressers, are often used to recreate situations which individuals find particularly relaxing and ASMR inducing. Such high levels of personal attention can result in the videos being misinterpreted as having sexual connotations, and the media’s exploration of ASMR has played on the sexualised interpretation of ASMR.
 </p><p>
The Guardian are one of many news publications to dub the ASMR sensation as a “head orgasm” (note their 2016 article titled ‘The ASMR videos that give YouTube viewers 'head orgasms'’). 
</p><p>
It seems that the media’s emphasis on ‘orgasm’ is a combination of a lack of understanding of the term and their aim to shock and attract the reader, but for individuals who have never heard of ASMR or watched a video, this representation can be quite misleading and off-putting. 
</p><p>
However, ASMR has begun to be explored more thoroughly in the mainstream media. I stumbled upon a one-off radio 4 programme titled ‘Brain Tingles’ hosted by comedian Isy Suttie. She explored not only her favourite ASMR YouTube channels but research in the field. This is how I discovered that the University of Sheffield, is one of very few institutions that have carried out research in the field of ASMR. 
</p><p>
I reached out to Dr Emma Blakey who is one of four researchers at the University of Sheffield carrying out research into ASMR. I wanted to know not only about the research conducted in the field of ASMR but what interested Blakey in researching ASMR in the first place, and what she thought we would see in the future for ASMR research. Blakey very kindly answered some of my questions. 
</p><p>

<b>What kind of experiments or research did you do surrounding ASMR?</b>
</p><p>
<i>We ran two studies. The first was a large online study where we wanted to understand what the triggers of ASMR were and whether watching ASMR videos affected a person's affect in terms of feeling more positive or negative, more relaxed or more stressed and whether this would differ for people who said they experienced ASMR vs people who did not. The second study brought people into the lab to measure physiological responses to ASMR videos compared to control videos. Participants were either ASMR experiencers or did not experience ASMR, allowing us to compare responses like heart rate and skin conductance to different videos and look at whether this differed for ASMR experiencers.</i>
</p><p>

<b>Was there much research in the field of ASMR prior to your study, as from my research it seems like there are relatively few individuals/institutions researching the area?</b>
</p><p>
<i>There was (and still is) very little research on this topic. ASMR - because it is so idiosyncratic - is hard to study but there has been a lot of research on other idiosyncratic phenomenon like synaesthesia. One study came out when we began researching this. The paper, by Nick Davis and Emma Barrett was a descriptive study focusing on ASMR experiencers and gave us some valuable early indication of the kinds of triggers people who have experience ASMR have. Since then, we are aware of a few other labs in North American who have begun to look at this. But we are a very long way off understanding the phenomenon and we hope our research results will really start to help us to understand it.</i>
</p><p>

<b>What interested you and the psychologists at the University of Sheffield in getting involved in a relatively new phenomenon?</b>
</p><p>
<i>We were all PhD students at the time and we were talking about running a study on it for a while as a couple of us experienced it and found out it had a name and not everyone did! We were surprised at how little research had been done which motivated us to do some research alongside our PhDs.</i>
</p><p>

<b>Do you see ASMR being a big area of research and interest in the future?</b>
</p><p>
<i>I really hope so. Many more people are now becoming aware of it as a phenomenon because of the media and YouTube channels dedicated to ASMR videos. There is huge potential for studies to offer insight into this given it's such an under explored area of research.</i>

</p><p>
My chat with Dr Emma Blakey gave me some interesting insight into the limited research undergone in the field of ASMR. I am excited that a small but growing phenomenon I stumbled across years ago is slowly becoming mainstream with the help of the media and ground-breaking research done right here in Sheffield.
