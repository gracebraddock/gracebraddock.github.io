    <h1>Government Forced to Publish Operation Yellowhammer Revealing the Risks of No-Deal   </h1>
	<p><b><i>This article was posted on the 11th of September 2019</b></i></p>		

	<p> After the passing of the Humble Address Motion, the UK Government has released the full Operation Yellowhammer documents. Excerpts from Operation Yellowhammer were first seen in The Times last month due to a highly documented leak and now the details of the worst case scenario Brexit have come to light.   </p>
  
  <p> In the document, it is claimed that delays for HGVs at the southern UK border could be as much as 2.5 days with “the worst disruption to the short Channel Straits” potentially lasting “up to 3 months”. In addition, “disruption to flow across Channel Straits would also cause significant queues in Kent”.  </p>
		 
  <p> Those with concerns about shortages of medicine may not be put at ease with revelations from Operation Yellowhammer. According to the document, “three-quarters of medicines come via the short straits” meaning medicines and medical products are “particularly vulnerable to severe extended delays”. Stockpiling may not be an adequate solution for many medicines that have short shelf lives leaving thousands across the country at risk. The report goes on to highlight the risk of disease spreading if medicines for veterinary use are hit by shortages.    </p>
  
  <p> Not all essentials will be as badly affected by the implementation of a no-deal Brexit. The government seem confident that the UK will face no water shortages and the risk of a failure in the chemical supply chain is considered low. However, further high risk consequences are outlined in Operation Yellowhammer, for instance the loss of access to law enforcement data shared between the UK and EU.   </p>
  
	<p> UK citizens living in EU countries will immediately lose the healthcare rights afforded by EU membership meaning it will be vital for all those currently living in the EU to organise private healthcare and insurance for post October 31st. </p>	
  <p> Whilst the Business Minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, previously dismissed this dossier as ‘scaremongering’ and ‘Project Fear’, this is the government’s own analysis of a ‘reasonable worst case scenario’ under a no-deal Brexit. However, last week opposition parties and rebel Tory MPs joined forces to pass a bill to block no-deal Brexit leaving many wondering whether the findings within Operation Yellowhammer remain a concern.   </p>
