    <h1>Johnson’s Prorogation of Parliament Leads to Increased Protests Around the Country  </h1>
	<p><b><i>This article was posted on the 9th of September 2019</b></i></p>		

	<p> After weeks of speculation that Boris Johnson would shut down Parliament to push through a no deal Brexit the prorogation of Parliament was announced on August 28th. Johnson and his cabinet members have insisted that the extended prorogation of Parliament is so government can bring forward a new legislative programme for MP’s to vote on after the recess.  </p>
  
  <p> However many are sceptical of the government’s intentions with a number of anti-Brexit and ‘Stop The Coup’ protesters taking to the streets across the country. On Wednesday protests began in the late afternoon continuing on late in to the evening in Parliament Square, with Great George Street being blocked by protesters. By 9pm some police officers were trying to encourage protesters to cease with one police officer asking “you are aware this has already made the news, how much longer will this go on?”  </p>

  <p> Protests resumed on the 31st of August with far more enthusiasm as roads were closed from Westminster Bridge to Trafalgar Square. Crowds formed outside the gates to Downing Street to sing anti-Boris and anti-Brexit chants and later in the day protests extended to the gates of Buckingham Palace.  </p>
  
  <p> In recent days many members of the opposition parties have praised the sustained efforts of protesters across the country. The opposition and Tory rebels have successfully passed legislation to block leaving the EU without a deal leading to the shocking removal of 21 MPs from the Conservative party. Johnson’s attempts to call a snap election have failed to garner enough support in the House of Commons, raising questions about what the next move is for a government that adamantly opposes extending Article 50.  </p>

  <p> This weekend saw pro-Brexit protesters take to the streets of London, with reports that 16 arrests were made after aggressive behaviour was shown towards counter protesters and police. With divisions as heightened as ever in the final weeks before the Brexit deadline, civil disobedience and conflict seem to be more likely than ever during this Brexit process.  </p>
