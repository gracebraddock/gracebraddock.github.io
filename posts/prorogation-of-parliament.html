<h1>Johnson’s Prorogation of Parliament Leads to Increased Protests in Westminster  </h1>
<p><b><i>This article was posted on the 9th of September 2019</b></i></p>		

<p> Protesters have taken to the streets across of London to decry Boris Johnson’s prorogation of Parliament. Since prorogation was announced on August 28th streets across Westminster have been filled with angry protesters who have condemned Johnson’s plans and labelled the planned shutdown of Parliament as a ‘coup’. </p>

<p> Anti-Brexit protesters have dismissed Johnson’s claims that the extended prorogation of Parliament is so “government can bring forward a new legislative programme for MP’s to vote on after the recess”. On Wednesday afternoon Parliament Square was filled with crowds of frustrated members of the public as chants of ‘stop the coup, save our democracy’ could be heard throughout Westminster.   </p>

<p> Protests went on in to the evening with Great George Street remaining closed for much of the night. By 9pm some police officers were trying to encourage protesters to cease with one police officer asking “you are aware this has already made the news, how much longer will this go on?” </p>		 
<p> Saturday saw protests resume with far more enthusiasm as roads were closed from Westminster Bridge to Trafalgar Square. Crowds formed outside the gates to Downing Street to sing anti-Boris and anti-Brexit chants and later in the day protests extended to the gates of Buckingham Palace.  </p>

<p> In recent days many members of the opposition parties have praised the sustained efforts of protesters across the country. The opposition and Tory rebels have successfully passed legislation to block leaving the EU without a deal leading to the shocking removal of 21 MPs from the Conservative party. Johnson’s attempts to call a snap election have failed to garner enough support in the House of Commons, raising questions about what the next move is for a government that adamantly opposes extending Article 50.  </p>


<p> This weekend saw pro-Brexit protesters take to the streets of London, with reports that 16 arrests were made after aggressive behaviour was shown towards counter protesters and police. With divisions as heightened as ever in the final weeks before the Brexit deadline, civil disobedience and conflict seem to be more likely than ever during this Brexit process.  </p>
