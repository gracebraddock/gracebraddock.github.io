<h1>Drovers Centre closure leaves upset and uncertainty for elderly users</h1>

<p>Elderly residents have attacked the council’s decision to close the Drovers Centre following a two-month long consultation. </p>
<p>There was upset on Thursday evening when councillors announced that Drovers is set to close in January 2020. The council plans to build social housing where the day centre currently stands. </p>
<p>Some regular users of the service attended the Executive Meeting held at the Town Hall to voice their disappointment. </p>
<p>Irma Gomez, a Drovers regular, pleaded with the committee: “We will end up with no community centre and that is very sad. I ask you to think again, build houses but don’t destroy these services for the community.” </p>
<p>Barbara, another Drovers user, said: “We pay enough council tax that’s where it should go. With more older people we need more of [these facilities].” </p>
<p>Councillor Janet Burgess appeared to shift blame to Age UK Islington’s decision to part ways with Drovers saying “it is this [decision] which has been the catalyst for this action”. Age UK Islington has not responded to requests for comment. </p> 
<p>Burgess also said that there were only 100 responses to the consultation that was sent to “over 500 people”.  This sparked fury from those representing the Drovers Centre, with one woman telling Islington Now: “The figures that they’re using are a load of nonsense… it must be higher than that because we had the [petition] as well… that was over 200 [signatures].” </p>
<p>Councillors reassured users of Drovers that many of the services would be picked up by the four community centres in the Holloway area, with particular focus on Goodinge Community Centre, which is minutes from the Drovers Centre. </p>
<p>However, Doris Hester, the chair of Goodinge informed Islington Now that “[the centre] cannot take on the people that are displaced at Drovers”. </p>
<p>Councillor Burgess said: “That’s not what they’ve been saying to our officers or Age UK.” </p>
<p>In response to Burgess’ comment, a Goodinge worker who asked to remain unnamed said the council were “talking out of their backsides”, insisting there is no space in their timetable for additional services. </p>
