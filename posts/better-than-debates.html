    <h1>Better Than the Debates? May’s Confidence Could Be Her Downfall</h1>
		<p><b><i>This article appeared as part of the Opinion section in the Forge Press June 2017 issue</i></b></p><p>
    May’s decision to boycott TV debates show a worrying attitude towards the election. Some may see it as her certainty at a lack of a Labour threat, others a disillusionment with the public’s dissatisfaction with the current state of UK politics. 
</p><p>
Following her announcement for the snap election over 100,000 18-25 year olds and nearly 100,000 25-34 year olds registered to vote in two days, suggesting millennials are ready to have their voices heard.</p><p>
By refusing the debate May has essentially said that she thinks there’s no competition, but also that she won’t fight for what she believes in. Avoiding the screen does not paint a picture of a passionate leader with strong integrity. Her role as a politician is to represent and listen to the people, yet she has disregarded the opinion of thousands who believe that she should participate in the debates, simply because she doesn’t think they warrant the energy.</p><p>
By not going on TV, May is putting in the bare minimum for her campaign. If the leader of our country doesn’t believe she has to debate, how is she supposed to encourage and persuade the apathetic public that there is any point in getting involved in the politics of their country?</p>
<p>
For a leader who has yet to run in a General Election to skip the debates is a bold decision. Maybe it’s fear rather than confidence that has caused her to shy away instead of stand tall in the face of her opposition.
</p>
<p>
Whether the polls are showing a landslide in your favour or a close race, in the run up to elections the leader should be doing anything and everything to get their voice heard. We should be rallying behind someone who debates because they care enough to do so, not because they have to.
