    <h1>Better Than the debates? May’s Confidence Could Be Her Downfall</h1><p>
    Last week Number 10 announced Theresa May would not be participating in TV debates ahead of the General Election. A spokesperson from the Conservative party stated, “The choice at this election is already clear: strong and stable leadership in the national interest with Theresa May and the Conservatives, or weak and unstable coalition government led by Jeremy Corbyn”. May’s presumptuous attitude towards the election and her certainty at a lack of a Labour threat highlight just how disillusioned she is with the public’s dissatisfaction with her Tory government. Following her announcement for the snap election over 100,000 18-25 year olds and nearly 100,000 25-34 year olds registered to vote in only two days, suggesting Millennials are ready for a change.

By refusing the debate May has essentially said, aside from the fact she thinks there’s no competition, that she doesn’t care about voicing her beliefs or fighting for what she believes in. For all the undecided voters out there, it doesn’t paint the picture of a passionate leader with strong integrity. Her role as a politician is to represent and listen to the people, yet she has disregarded the opinion of thousands who believe that she should participate in the debates, simply because she doesn’t think they warrant the energy. It comes down to her doing the bare minimum for her campaign. If the leader of our country is so apathetic she doesn’t believe she has to debate, how is she supposed to encourage and persuade the apathetic public that there is any point in getting involved in the politics of their country?

It’s not only arrogant to dismiss the debates, but stupid. Whether the polls are showing a landslide in your favour or a close race, in the run up to elections the leader should be doing anything and everything to get their voice heard. For May to think she doesn’t need to debate because she’s got a strong lead shows the voters exactly why they shouldn’t be voting for her. We should be rallying behind someone who debates because they care not because they have to. Why would you want to vote someone that can’t be bothered to inform the public what it is they stand for? 
</p><p>
For a leader that wasn’t even elected, skipping the debates is a bold decision. Maybe it’s fear rather than confidence that has caused her to shy away instead of stand tall in the face of her opposition.
