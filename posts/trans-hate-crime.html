<h1>Hate crime in England and Wales at an all-time high </h1>


<p>Hate crime in England and Wales is at an all-time high, with all forms of hate crime except racist and religious increasing at a higher rate outside of London.</p>

<p>Data from Met Police and the Home Office shows that all hate crime is on the rise, with transphobic hate crime seeing the most significant increase this year. </p>

<p>Despite England and Wales seeing larger increases in homophobic, transphobic and disability hate crimes, racist and religious hate crimes have seen a slightly bigger percentage increase in London. </p>

<p>Racist and religious hate crime has increased 11.5% in London in the last year from 16,002 cases in 2018 to 18,080 in 2019. </p>

<p>In contrast, the same crime has seen a 9% increase in England and Wales in the last year with the number of cases increasing to 87,557 in 2018/19 from 79,603 in 2017/18. </p>

<p>This comes amid a number of high profile cases of racist and religious hate in London this year, including a Met Police investigation into 12 cases of antisemitic graffiti in Hampstead and Belsize Park this week. </p>

<p>Lorraine Huddle, the secretary of Stand up to Racism Waltham Forest, was surprised by these statistics, saying: “It’s very worrying that it’s going up around London.” </p> 

<p>Stand up to Racism believe that these sorts of attacks can be fought in numbers. Huddle said: “Our thing is just getting as many people together and out and in solidarity with each other so that we can take them on.” </p>

<p>However she acknowledged the difficulty of fighting racism in the capital saying: “In London one of the things that works against us is that it’s so big and getting your voice out there is sometimes really tough.” </p>

<p>In contrast to these figures, all other hate crime increased at a higher rate outside of London. </p>

<p>Transphobic hate crime has seen the biggest increase in both London and England and Wales, but the increase has been smaller in the capital. </p>

<p>This year, transphobic hate crime increased by 23.7% from 213 crimes in 2018 to 279 in 2019. This is the biggest increase seen in all the published data, which starts at April 2010.</p>

<p>Whereas in England and Wales the rate has increased by 37% from 1,703 crimes in 2017/18 to 2,333 in 2018/19. </p>

<p>This is the worst increase seen for any hate crime since the Home Office started publishing figures in 2011. </p>

<p>Lily Madigan is a trans woman who experienced negative media attention when she stood for the role of women’s officer in the Labour Party.</p> 

<p>Speaking of the media’s focus on trans issues, she said: “Last year there were more stories on trans people than days in the year, which I find incredible really. And none of them are particularly nice.”</p>

<p>She added: “I think most people have been introduced to trans people through really demonising media and that plays a large part, especially in the past few years as hate crime has grown a lot.”</p>

<p>She was also not surprised to see a higher increase in trans hate crime outside of London saying: “London is a lot of things but it tends to be much more liberal and accepting… [that’s] part of the reason why I moved to London.”</p>

<p>Jane Fae, the Secretary of Trans Media Watch was less convinced that media coverage of trans people has affected the general public on the whole. </p>

<p>However she believes the shift in coverage of transgender people from “freak show” to “political threat” has led “the politicians and commentators” to “parrot” the lies spread about trans people. </p>

<p>The Home Office said that the rise in transphobic hate crime may be due to “improvements made by the police in their identification and recording of these hate crime offences” and “more people coming forward”. </p>

<p>The Home Office added: “However, genuine increases cannot be ruled out.” </p>

<p>But Jane Fae thinks “the vast majority of hate crime is unreported”. </p>

<p>She said: “There’s been a lack of confidence that anything will get done about it and I have to say that I’m in the same boat. There have been instances where I’ve thought is it really worth it?”</p>

<p>Speaking of her own experience, she said: “I had an incident once, I was in a car park with a friend… and a group of idiots in a car thought it would be funny to drive the car at me to try and knock me out and I just got of their way and carried on.”</p>

<p>“My friend said afterwards if they’d tried to do that to her she would have gone absolutely ballistic and I thought that was interesting because I hadn’t even realised that I’d got so good at ignoring it, but even in an instance like that I didn’t report.” </p>

<p>It’s not just transphobic and racist and religious hate crime that has seen an increase in the capital. </p>

<p>Disability hate crime in London is now four times higher than it was eight years ago. Hate crimes based on sexuality have more than doubled in the last eight years with an almost 17% increase this year alone. </p>
