<h1> “I was never an anxious person before I was a Mum”: The moving story of a mother's fight for her miracle IVF identical twins </h1>

<p>“The risk of severe injury is 40% in a forward-facing car seat and 8% in a rear-facing one” Laura Etson explains to her sister who is squeezed between her two rear-facing nieces in the back, “it’s a no brainer”. </p>

<p>“Welcome to the house of twins”, Laura jokes, as we get out of the car and enter the dining room with laundry drying on airers and a view of a living room lined with a princess tent, doll house and kitchen set. </p>

<p>At 33, Laura is the mother of identical twins Sophie and Lily, aged 3 years and 8 months. Her ‘miracle babies’ are the result of an arduous and expensive (£4000) IVF process. Laura was lucky as her fight to have children paid off despite the odds stacked against her. </p>

<p>And her odds on paper were pretty poor. Between 2014 and 2016, the number of women aged under 35 that had a fully successful IVF treatment was 23 per cent. And while the likeliness of IVF resulting in paternal twins is much higher than in natural conception, the likelihood of having identical twins is 0.95 per cent. </p>

<p>After two years of trying to conceive naturally Laura and her husband visited the doctor to consider other options. But because Shaun has an older child from a previous relationship they were unable to get treatment on the NHS. “They kind of just shut the door on us in terms of even an investigation,” Laura remembers. </p>

<p>Although Laura loves her step son, she had always desperately wanted her own children. 
So instead the couple decided to go privately with Dr Ah-Moe at the Herts and Essex fertility clinic.</p> 

<p>It is clear that this was a one-time attempt that they were giving their all. Laura confirms this when she tells me how Dr Ah-Moe worked beneath the doctor responsible for the second IVF baby in the UK. “We threw everything at it”, she says. “Anything we could pay extra for to make it even more likely to be a success we did it.” </p>

<p>Laura meticulously recalls the various tests and details of the IVF process, even though it’s almost four years later. “What they found was that my AMH level was very low” she says, pausing to explain what AMH is (Anti-Müllerian hormone, all to do with your egg reserve) and the level hers were compared with what they should have been. Laura continues matter-of-factly, “I was only 30 at the time but I had the ovarian reserve similar to a 43-year-old woman”. </p>

<p>Laura recalls how they collected four eggs while only two embryos successfully fertilised and were implanted. Laura’s intense anxiety during that time is palpable even now as she recalls the weeks that followed, “I wasn’t meant to do a pregnancy test until the following Friday so two weeks post egg collection but I’m really impatient so I did my first test a week after transfer. </p>

<p>“I spent hundreds, I’m not even joking you hundreds. I did the cheap ones and the expensive ones. I’ve got so many pictures of pregnancy tests.” </p>

<p>Laura even found out she was having twins from an extra scan she booked a week before her scheduled scan. She recalls, “my private scan with the clinic wasn’t until just over seven weeks but around six weeks I just didn’t feel pregnant… and because I’m a worrier and I overthink stuff I decided to go to a place in Watford and have a private scan.” </p>

<p>“[The nurse] very casually told me I was having two babies so that was the initial shock and from there she was able to tell me they were going to be identical as well.” </p>

<p>Laura’s overthinking during the early pregnancy makes more sense when she tells me that she suffered two miscarriages before turning to IVF. Unfortunately for Laura this pregnancy did not ease her nerves as the twins developed twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. This resulted in “one severely anaemic twin and one with too much blood”, meaning she had to give birth prematurely at 32 weeks. </p>

<p>She isn’t visibly upset when she recalls the details of her birth but her voice softens slightly leaving me to assume it’s a difficult period to return to.  “I didn’t actually get to meet them for 24 hours which was hard.” </p>

<p>I detect a hint of understatement when she speaks about the difficulty of having her daughters whisked away to the special care unit with only a quick glance of them. “I think in terms of bonding the first 24 hours is quite crucial and to not even know what they properly look like or to have held them or had any skin-to-skin to them or anything was quite difficult.” </p>

<p>The mood lightens when the conversation shifts to her C-section and she confidently informs her sister that it is not the easy way out of child birth. “If you can push them out the boot darling it’s much better than coming out the sun roof,” Laura jokes. </p>

<p>Laura is fascinated by her twins, proudly pointing out their twin quirks, whispering to me to watch as one begins crying and a moment later the other follows suit. “They’re very entertaining, I can just sit here watching them play for hours,” she says. </p>

<p>After the interview we have a bit of small talk about London and the tube which somehow leads us back to the twins. “I was never an anxious person before I was a Mum” she says. She remembers when they first brought the girls home from hospital in the middle of a heat wave and had to leave their window open overnight. “I would wake up in fear that a fox would jump through the window.” She laughs, “totally irrational I know.” </p>

<p>When we are returning to the car Laura points out the girls’ window. The window is blocked by bars and is at least 15 feet from the ground so I initially find myself somewhat amused. But her twins are without a doubt a miracle so it’s hardly surprising that Laura is safety conscious, whether it be window bars or rear-facing car seats. </p>
